# Shop page
_Goal: Create a page to sell developer products in a game._

[add an image of the result we are expecting]

## Top Component
Let's start by creating the top level component, that will be the page containing the items for sale in the game.

```lua

```

### Viewing the component


## Items Grid


## Product Item
[remind state and props]

### Adding some animations


## Integration

### In a Roact project
Here explain how the component can be used my another component or how it can be mounted on it's own (like main.client.lua does)

### In a non-Roact project
Explain how the page could be mounted in an existing UI instances tree. That opens the subject that it is possible to slowly port an existing UI to use Roact part by part.
