## Methods

### Roact.createElement
```
Roact.createElement(component, [props, [children]]) -> RoactElement
```

Creates a new Roact element representing the given `component`.

The `children` argument is shorthand for adding a `Roact.Children` key to `props`. It should be specified as a dictionary of names to elements.

`component` can be a string, a function, or a table created by `Component:extend`.

!!! caution
	Once `props` or `children` are passed into the `createElement`, make sure not to modify them!

### Roact.mount
```
Roact.mount(element, [parent, [key]]) -> ComponentInstanceHandle
```

!!! info
	`Roact.mount` is also available via the deprecated alias `Roact.reify`. It will be removed in a future release.

Creates a Roblox Instance given a Roact element, and optionally a `parent` to put it in, and a `key` to use as the instance's `Name`.

The result is a `ComponentInstanceHandle`, which is an opaque handle that represents this specific instance of the root component. You can pass this to APIs like `Roact.unmount` and the future debug API.

### Roact.reconcile
```
Roact.reconcile(instanceHandle, element) -> ComponentInstanceHandle
```

Updates an existing instance handle with a new element, returning a new handle.

`reconcile` can be used to change the props of a component instance created with `mount` and is useful for putting Roact content into non-Roact applications.

!!! warning
	`Roact.reconcile` takes ownership of the `instanceHandle` passed into it and may unmount it and mount a new tree!

	Make sure to use the handle that `reconcile` returns in any operations after `reconcile`, including `unmount`.

### Roact.unmount
```
Roact.unmount(instance) -> void
```

!!! info
	`Roact.unmount` is also available via the deprecated alias `Roact.teardown`. It will be removed in a future release.

Destroys the given `ComponentInstanceHandle` and all of its descendents. Does not operate on a Roblox Instance -- this must be given a handle that was returned by `Roact.mount`.

### Roact.oneChild
`Roact.oneChild(children) -> RoactElement | nil`

Given a dictionary of children, returns a single child element.

If `children` contains more than one child, `oneChild` function will throw an error. This is intended to denote an error when using the component using `oneChild`.

If `children` is `nil` or contains no children, `oneChild` will return `nil`.

### Roact.createRef
```
Roact.createRef() -> Ref
```

Creates a new reference object that can be used with [Roact.Ref](#roactref).

## Constants

### Roact.Children
This is the key that Roact uses internally to store the children that are attached to a Roact element.

If you're writing a new functional or stateful element that needs to be used like a primitive component, you can access `Roact.Children` in your props table.

### Roact.Ref
Use `Roact.Ref` as a key into the props of a primitive element to receive a handle to the underlying Roblox Instance.

Assign this key to a reference object created with [createRef](#roactcreateref):
```lua
local ExampleComponent = Roact.Component:extend("ExampleComponent")

function ExampleComponent:init()
	-- Create a reference object.
	self.ref = Roact.createRef()
end

function ExampleComponent:render()
	return Roact.createElement("Frame", {
		-- Use the reference object to point to this rendered instance.
		[Roact.Ref] = self.ref,
	})
end

function ExampleComponent:didMount()
	-- Access the current value of a reference object using its current property.
	print("Roblox Instance", self.ref.current)
end
```

Alternatively, you can assign it to a function instead:
```lua
Roact.createElement("Frame", {
	-- The provided function will be called whenever the rendered instance changes.
	[Roact.Ref] = function(rbx)
		print("Roblox Instance", rbx)
	end,
})
```

!!! warning
	When `Roact.Ref` is given a funciton, Roact does not guarantee when this function will be run relative to the reconciliation of other props. If you try to read a Roblox property that's being set via a Roact prop, you won't know if you're reading it before or after Roact reconciles that prop!

!!! warning
	When `Roact.Ref` is given a funciton, it will be called with `nil` when the component instance is destroyed!

See [the refs guide](/advanced/refs.md) for more details.

### Roact.Event
Index into `Roact.Event` to receive a key that can be used to connect to events when creating primitive elements:

```lua
Roact.createElement("ImageButton", {
	[Roact.Event.MouseButton1Click] = function(rbx, x, y)
		print(rbx, "clicked at position", x, y)
	end,
})
```

!!! info
	Event callbacks receive the Roblox Instance as the first parameter, followed by any parameters yielded by the event.

!!! warning
	When connecting to the `Changed` event, be careful not to call `setState` or other functions that will trigger renders. This will cause Roact to re-render during a render, and errors will be thrown!

See [the events guide](/guide/events.md) for more details.

### Roact.Change
Index into `Roact.Change` to receive a key that can be used to connect to [`GetPropertyChangedSignal`](http://wiki.roblox.com/index.php?title=API:Class/Instance/GetPropertyChangedSignal) events.

It's similar to `Roact.Event`:

```lua
Roact.createElement("ScrollingFrame", {
	[Roact.Change.CanvasPosition] = function(rbx, position)
		print("ScrollingFrame scrolled to", position)
	end,
})
```

!!! warning
	Property changed events are fired by Roact during the reconciliation phase. Be careful not to accidentally trigger a re-render in the middle of a re-render, or an error will be thrown!

### Roact.None
`Roact.None` is a special value that can be used to clear elements from your component state when calling `setState` or returning from `getDerivedStateFromProps`.

In Lua tables, removing a field from state is not possible by setting its value to `nil` because `nil` values mean the same thing as no value at all. If a field needs to be removed from state, it can be set to `Roact.None` when calling `setState`, which will ensure that the resulting state no longer contains it:

```lua
function MyComponent:didMount()
	self:setState({
		fieldToRemove = Roact.None
	})
end
```

## Component Types

### Roact.Component
The base component instance that can be extended to make stateful components.

Call `Roact.Component:extend("ComponentName")` to make a new stateful component with a given name.

### Roact.PureComponent
An extension of `Roact.Component` that only re-renders if its props or state change.

`PureComponent` implements the `shouldUpdate` lifecycle event with a shallow equality comparison. It's optimized for use with immutable data structures, which makes it a perfect fit for use with frameworks like Rodux.

`PureComponent` is not *always* faster, but can often result in significant performance improvements when used correctly.

### Roact.Portal
A component that represents a *portal* to a Roblox Instance. Portals are created using `Roact.createElement`.

Any children of a portal are put inside the Roblox Instance specified by the required `target` prop. That Roblox Instance should not be one created by Roact.

Portals are useful for creating dialogs managed by deeply-nested UI components, and enable Roact to represent and manage multiple disjoint trees at once.

See [the Portals guide](/advanced/portals.md) for a small tutorial and more details about portals.

## Component API

### defaultProps
```
static defaultProps: Dictionary<any, any>
```

If `defaultProps` is defined on a stateful component, any props that aren't specified when a component is created will be taken from there.

### init
```
init(initialProps) -> void
```

`init` is called exactly once when a new instance of a component is created. It can be used to set up the initial `state`, as well as any non-`render` related values directly on the component.

Use `setState` inside of `init` to set up your initial component state:

```lua
function MyComponent:init()
	self:setState({
		position = 0,
		velocity = 10
	})
end
```

In older versions of Roact, `setState` was disallowed in `init`, and you would instead assign to `state` directly. This is still acceptable, but it's simpler to use `setState`:

```lua
function MyComponent:init()
	self.state = {
		position = 0,
		velocity = 10
	}
end
```

### render
```
render() -> Element | nil
```

`render` describes what a component should display at the current instant in time.

!!! info
	Roact assumes that `render` act likes a pure function: the result of `render` must depend only on `props` and `state`, and it must not have side-effects.

```lua
function MyComponent:render()
	-- This is okay:
	return Roact.createElement("TextLabel", {
		Text = self.props.text,
		Position = self.state.position
	})

	-- Ack! Depending on values outside props/state is not allowed!
	return Roact.createElement("TextLabel", {
		Text = self.someText,
		Position = getMousePosition(),
	})
end
```

`render` must be defined for all components. The default implementation of `render` throws an error; if your component does not render anything, define a render function that returns `nil` explicitly.

```lua
function MyComponent:render()
	return nil
end
```

### setState
```
setState(stateUpdater | stateChange) -> void
```

`setState` *requests* an update to the component's state. Roact may schedule this update for a later time or resolve it immediately.

If a function is passed to `setState`, that function will be called with the current state and props as arguments:

```lua
function MyComponent:didMount()
	self:setState(function(prevState, props)
		return {
			counter = prevState.counter + 1
		}
	end)
end
```

If this function returns `nil`, Roact will not schedule a re-render and no state will be updated.

If a table is passed to `setState`, the values in that table will be merged onto the existing state:

```lua
function MyComponent:didMount()
	self:setState({
		foo = "bar"
	})
end
```

Setting a field in the state to `Roact.None` will clear it from the state. This is the only way to remove a field from a component's state!

!!! warning
	`setState` can be called from anywhere **except**:

	* Lifecycle hooks: `willUnmount`
	* Pure functions: `render`, `shouldUpdate`

	Calling `setState` inside of `init` or `willUpdate` has different behavior in other places. Because Roact is already going to render or update a component in these cases, the update will be replaced instead of another update happening.

	Roact may support calling `setState` in currently-disallowed places in the future.

!!! warning
	**`setState` does not always resolve synchronously!** Roact may batch and reschedule state updates in order to reduce the number of total renders.

	When depending on the previous value of state, like when incrementing a counter, use the functional form to guarantee that all state updates occur!

	This behavior will be similar to the future behavior of React 17. See:

	* [RFClarification: why is `setState` asynchronous?](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11527#issuecomment-360199710)
	* [Does React keep the order for state updates?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48610973/802794)

### shouldUpdate
```
shouldUpdate(nextProps, nextState) -> bool
```

`shouldUpdate` provides a way to override Roact's rerendering heuristics.

Right now, components are re-rendered any time a parent component updates, or when state is updated via `setState`.

`PureComponent` implements `shouldUpdate` to only trigger a re-render any time the props are different based on shallow equality. In a future Roact update, *all* components may implement this check by default.

### getElementTraceback
```
getElementTraceback() -> string | nil
```

`getElementTraceback` gets the stack trace that the component was created in. This allows you to report error messages accurately.

## Lifecycle Methods
In addition to the base Component API, Roact exposes additional lifecycle methods that stateful components can hook into to be notified of various steps in the rendering process.

### didMount
```
didMount() -> void
```

`didMount` is fired after the component finishes its initial render. At this point, all associated Roblox Instances have been created, and all components have finished mounting.

`didMount` is a good place to start initial network communications, attach events to services, or modify the Roblox Instance hierarchy.

### willUnmount
```
willUnmount() -> void
```

`willUnmount` is fired right before Roact begins unmounting a component instance's children.

`willUnmount` acts like a component's destructor, and is a good place to disconnect any manually-connected events.

### willUpdate
```
willUpdate(nextProps, nextState) -> void
```

`willUpdate` is fired after an update is started but before a component's state and props are updated.

`willUpdate` can be used to make tweaks to your component's state using `setState`. Often, this should be done in `getDerivedStateFromProps` instead.

### didUpdate
```
didUpdate(previousProps, previousState) -> void
```

`didUpdate` is fired after at the end of an update. At this point, the reconciler has updated the properties of any Roblox Instances and the component instance's props and state are up to date.

`didUpdate` is a good place to send network requests or dispatch Rodux actions, but make sure to compare `self.props` and `self.state` with `previousProps` and `previousState` to avoid triggering too many updates.

### getDerivedStateFromProps
```
static getDerivedStateFromProps(nextProps, lastState) -> nextStateSlice
```

Used to recalculate any state that depends on being synchronized with `props`.

Generally, you should use `didUpdate` to respond to props changing. If you find yourself copying props values to state as-is, consider using props or memoization instead.

`getDerivedStateFromProps` should return a table that contains the part of the state that should be updated.

```lua
function MyComponent.getDerivedStateFromProps(nextProps, lastState)
	return {
		someValue = nextProps.someValue
	}
end
```

As with `setState`, you can set use the constant `Roact.None` to remove a field from the state.

!!! note
	`getDerivedStateFromProps` is a *static* lifecycle method. It does not have access to `self`, and must be a pure function.
